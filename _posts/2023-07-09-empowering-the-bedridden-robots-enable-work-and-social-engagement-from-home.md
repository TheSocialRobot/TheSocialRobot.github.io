## Introduction

This is not my typical story about AI and robots, but I found the idea so inspiring that I had to say something about it. The western narrative around robots is often negative and it's good to see a more positive outlook.

The [Avatar Cafe DAWN ver.β](https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/) in Tokyo is staffed by robots. However, these robots are not controlled by AI, but by people who are unable to leave their own homes. What's more the "pilots" of these robots are paid the standard rate for wait-staff in Japan meaning that they are able to earn a living.

Many people found the social isolation caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns hard. But at least the lockdowns came to an end. What about people suffering from an illness or disability leaving them bedridden? A Japanese company aims to allow them to get out into the world again too.

The Japanese [Ory Laboratory](https://orylab.com/) has a mission to "solve loneliness through technology" and they're trying out a novel way to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to leave their homes to work and socialise.

## The idea

If people can't leave their house in their own bodies, then give them robot bodies as avatars. Whereas muscle suits or exeskeletons can help people who have some mobility, a robot avatar can allow people who are completely bedridden to have a presence in the world. This is not only a limited time trial but an ongoing operation since 2021. What's more it gives people a means to earn an income.

This is called "telepresence" - giving someone a presence in a place some distance from their physical body. It's not a new idea, the term telepresence dates from the 1980s, but as far as I know it's always been intended as a way to "transport" able-bodied people to enable them to work in hazadous environments or communicate with other people without needing to physically travel. I find this new use of it much more appealing because its enabling people who don't even have the option to travel to make contact with other people.

The people who control the robots - The Ory Laboratory refers to them as "pilots" - are given an interface appropriate to their condition. The exact form of the interface is not specified, but there are several options:

- controlling the robot using gaze direction
- mouse-based interface using hands
- mouse-based interface controlled using mouth

Having to control every movement of a robot using this sort of interface could be cumbersome and tiring so there are a number of pre-defined movements that can be triggered (not clear if pilots can add additional movements). The robots are also capable of following pre-defined paths between known locations which makes navigating between places less hassle.

As well as moving about the robot bodies are capable of grasping small objects and have microphones and speakers so that the pilots can communicate with people using either their natural voice (if possible) or a synthesized voice.

## The cafe

Once disabled people have access to telepresence what should they do? Ory Laboratory's answer is that they can both support themselves via work and develop social contacts. This in achieved not in a lab, but in a cafe.

Whereas other places staffed by robots seem gimmicky - the robots being present more for novelty value or entertainment than utilty - the [Avatar Cafe DAWN ver.β](https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/) provides a means for disabled people to earn a living and have greater social contact with other people. It also allows able-bodied visitors to talk to the "pilots" and perhaps learn more about what it's like to be permamently cut-off from the world. Hopefully, this will promote empathy and greater understanding of the difficulties faced by heavily disabled people.

Fittingly, the cafe also makes provision for visitors who are not able-bodied

The [Avatar Cafe DAWN ver.β](https://dawn2021.orylab.com/en/) in Tokyo is staffed by robots. However, these robots are not controlled by AI, but by people who are unable to leave their own homes. What's more the "pilots" of these robots are paid the standard rate for wait-staff in Japan meaning that they are able to earn a living. As well as movement the robots allow the pilots to speak to customers. The pilots can also change the robots eye colour to show their mood. A table or phone-like "name badge" can also be worn by the robots so that customers can learn a bit more about the pilot. Customers and pilots are encouraged to talk.

## The robot

The OriHime-D robots that wait tables at the cafe are 120cm tall - the height was chosen to be close to that of a 6 year-old child to make the robot seem unthreatening. The robot has 14 joint motors in the upper body and moves on two omniwheels. The arms are strong enough to hold a 500g bottle when extended
